# Project Log

### Date: September 4, 2025

- Finalized the Project Charter and README based on the critical findings from the Bao et al. "How Far to NISN" paper.
- The SOTA to beat is the ~0.16 cosine similarity for a 2-category alignment task on Chisco-1.0.
- Initial documentation is complete and committed.
- Wrote and executed the first data loading script in 04_Notebooks/01_chisco_data_exploration.ipynb. Successfully loaded a raw .edf file into MNE and generated an interactive visualization of the EEG signals.
- Next: Build the full preprocessing pipeline based on the steps outlined in the Bao et al. and original Chisco papers.
